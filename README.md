# 👋 Hi, I'm Aman Kumar

I'm transitioning from a discretionary derivatives trading background to systematic/quantitative strategy design.  
I've managed a ₹50 Cr options book and deployed strategies like delta-hedging, expiry straddles, CR, butterflies, and iron flies.

Now, I’m rebuilding that edge through code.

## 🧠 Learning Focus
- Python for Quant Strategy  
- Volatility Modeling  
- Backtesting Frameworks  
- Market Microstructure  
- Systematic Thinking

## 🛠️ Current Projects
- Backtesting expiry straddles  
- Delta hedge simulations  
- Leetcode logic builder  
- Quant roadmap (public repo)

## 📚 Recent Additions
- [quant-roadmap](https://github.com/AmanKumarTrader/quant-roadmap)  
- [strategy-backtests](https://github.com/AmanKumarTrader/strategy-backtests)  

Let’s connect — I’m building in public.
